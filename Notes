Tile
attributes:
type
location
passable(?)


World:
attributes:
dimensions (note = App.TILE_SIZE * x or y)
2D array of tile types

setxDim()
setyDim()
setFloorLayout() =  floor(from csv reader)

Loader:
Read CSV
    final static, XCOORD = 1, YCOORD = 2, TILE_ID = 0
    first line = readline -> xdim, ydim
    floor = new String[xdim][ydim]
    then for loop of readline until EOF
    split by ","
    floor[line[xdim]][line[ydim]] = line[TILE_ID]



identifyTile():
- floor
- stone
- target






Tasks:
Take first line of CSV -> dimensions of World
Make tile class
Read csv file into 2D array
Make 2D array of tile classes


Ideas

their sprite = my tile = superclass?
